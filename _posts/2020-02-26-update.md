# Project Diversity

## What am I doing?

Had a Project Diversity meeting this morning, I'm still not super sure what we're supposed to be doing. Putting together a couple of events, but why? for who? I mean, it's to help increase native visibility, but I'm still just so confused. lol. How is this different from the Indigenous ERG I'm a part of? Why aren't all the people in one in the other? It is a county group. These, I feel, are questions without answers.
